# API and SDK (Q1.1)

## API Types

<!-- Main API Types + API Types by service -->

Before talking about *types* of **APIs** we need to understand first **what is an API**?

### What is an API?

An **API** which *stands* for **Application Programming Interface**, is a *type of interface* that allows *programs* to **connect with eachother**, where *one* or *both* of them **offer a service** to other programs by a **set of rules**.

### Main API types

- ***Public APIs***: these *APIs* **don't** introduce  any **restrictions of access** because they are **fully available to the public**. (***moderate security and authentication***)

- ***Partner APIs***: these *APIs* **are not available** to the **public**, and *require* a **licese to access**. (***strong security and authentication***)

- ***Private APIs***: these *APIs* are for **internal use only**, it is used to *connect* **inhouse programs/systems together**. (***weak to none security and authentication***)

- ***Composite APIs***:these *APIs* are a **combination** of the **previous API types**. (***security and authentication depends on API choices***)

### Web service APIs

- **SOAP**: which stands for **Simple Object Access Protocol**, is a **messaging protocol** that *allows* machines to *communicate* using **HTTP** and **XML format files** to create, update, recover, and delete records.

- **REST**: which stands for **Representational State Transfer**, *isn't* a **protocol**, it's a *set* of **architectural principles**. This kind of *API* is **designed around resources**, and is **compatible with web services and database systems**.

- **XML-RPC**: this is a **protocol** used to get **XML formatted data** that is **passed using HTTP**. (*RPC* stands for **Remote Procedure Call**)

- **JSON-RPC**: same as **XML-RPC**, the *only difference* is that the *data* is **JSON formatted data**. (*RPC* stands for **Remote Procedure Call**)

## Benefits of APIs

- **Increases productivity** by *offering* developers **most of the functionalities and data** to **speed the development process**.
- **Saves costs** by **saving resources** and **time** that would otherwise be wasted.
- **Improves connectivity and collaboration** by allowing programs to use *resources* from eachother to complete tasks.
- **Automation**.
- **Less Space Consumption**.
- **Updated data from the provider**.
- Offers **personalization** for users by allowing them to **personalize sessions**.
- **Offers easier integration**.

## API and SDK difference analyzation

|API|SDK|
|--|---|
|Application Programming Interface|Software Development Kit|
|Interface|A set of tools|
|Includes libraries|Includes one or more APIs along with tools|

These are the main differences that i can think of, but we need to understand that both are used together to create robust applications.
